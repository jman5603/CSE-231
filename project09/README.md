# Project Details:

This project contains 2 ```.json``` files with machine learning data from images as well as a ```main.py``` file. The user gives the program one of the two filenames. The algorithm then searches through the data, finding key words and subjects that the machine learning model had found within the training images. The algorithm then formats this data and returns it to the user.
